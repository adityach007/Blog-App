# CodeBlog App

## Overview
CodeBlog App is a comprehensive application designed to facilitate the creation of engaging and informative blog posts using advanced AI technology. The app leverages Google's Generative AI and the Codestral API to generate high-quality content based on user inputs, providing a streamlined solution for bloggers, content creators, and businesses.

## Key Components and Technologies
1. **Streamlit**: A popular open-source framework used to create the web interface of the application.
2. **Google Generative AI**: An advanced AI model for generating natural language content.
3. **Codestral API**: An API used for generating code snippets and additional content.

## Detailed Workflow

### User Input
- Users enter the blog title, keywords, and desired length of the blog post through the sidebar of the Streamlit app.
- Keywords are provided as comma-separated values, and the length of the blog is selected using a slider ranging from 250 to 2000 words.

### Generate Blog
- Upon clicking the "Generate Blog" button, the input data (blog title, keywords, and desired length) is used to construct a prompt for the Google Generative AI model.
- The prompt includes specific instructions to generate a comprehensive blog post, divided into sections such as Introduction, Background Information, Main Points, Practical Tips, Benefits and Challenges, and Conclusion.

### Google Generative AI
- The AI model, configured with specified parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p, max_output_tokens, and safety settings), processes the prompt and generates the blog content.
- The generated content is then displayed in the main interface of the Streamlit app.

### Display Blog Content
- The blog content is presented to the user with proper formatting, ensuring readability and engagement.

### Generate Related Topics
- A separate prompt is sent to the Google Generative AI model to generate related blog topics based on the original blog title.
- The related topics are displayed in the sidebar, allowing users to explore further content ideas.

### Generate Code Snippet
- If the user clicks the "Want Code" button, a request is sent to the Codestral API with the blog title.
- The API processes the request and generates a relevant code snippet, which is displayed in the main interface.

### Generate Additional Content
- If the user clicks the "More" button, a request is sent to the Codestral API to generate more advanced and precise content related to the blog title.
- The additional content is displayed in the main interface, providing deeper insights into the topic.

### Session State Management
- Streamlit's session state is used to manage the content and user interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Variables such as `blog_content`, `related_topics`, `related_blog_content`, `show_more`, `show_code`, `code_content`, and `more_content` are used to store and display the generated content and user actions.
